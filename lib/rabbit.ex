  # Spawned onto a carrot patch
  #  -> eats any carrots there
  #    -> eating carrot patch resets patch to 0

  # Moves with each tick
  #  moves towards a random adjacent square with carrots
  #    -> cannot occupy a square that has an occupant (rabbit or future animal)
  #    -> eats those carrots
  #  or moves towards an random empty square


  # After eating 5 carrot patches
  #   -> second bunny appears in adjacent square


  # Dies after 50 rounds
